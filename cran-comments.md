## cran-comments for baggr v0.6.20

Run times for vignettes and examples have been shortened in recent versions and are under 600 seconds. I am working on reducing check time much more for v0.7 which will be next submission.

Test environments:

* win-builder: devel, old release
* Windows 10 PC locally: R 4.1.1
* Ubuntu 20.04 R x86_64 4.0.1 locally
* builder.r-hub.io (platforms = NULL)

There are no WARNINGs or ERRORs and 2 NOTEs in some environements:

N checking installed package size ... NOTE
  sub-directories of 1Mb or more: libs
  
N checking for GNU extensions in Makefiles ... NOTE
  GNU make is a SystemRequirements.
